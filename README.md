# Actimania
Game for [Vanier College's Robotics](https://www.facebook.com/VanierRobotics) team's kiosk and website. It is a simulation of the actual competition using a 3d model of the robot we designed.
* The game was run on arcade machines which we designed and built from the ground up.
* The arcade machines featured dynamic button LED lighting controlled by arduinos.
* The arcade machines were running on a computer and a MAME emulator for other arcade games.
